Papertrail â€“ Google Chrome extension for clickable links
=========================

This Google Chrome extension creates clickable links in log messages.

If a log message contains `<link>` (e. g. `<https://www.google.com/>`), this URL is turned into a clickable link.

It is [available in the Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/papertrail-clickable-link/dbgmfbodfabdpflmlmipapijbmgcgjfg).
